// One-plane YpCbCr shader: Supports all single-plane YpCbCr pixel formats. YpCbCr to RGB conversion
// is done using a coefficient matrix that's uploaded to the GPU via a uniform matrix. This shader also
// supports a PermuteMap to support various permutations on channel ordering in the source texture.
